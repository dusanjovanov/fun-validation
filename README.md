# Installation

```bash
  npm install fun-validation
```

```bash
  yarn add fun-validation
```

# Usage

This library exports a bunch of small validation functions that all have the following signature:

```tsx
  (value: any) => boolean

  // or when the validation requires additional parameters, we have currying:
  (n:number) => (value: any) => boolean
```

So you would call a function like this:

```tsx
import { isEmail } from 'fun-validation';

const isEmailValid = isEmail(someString);
```

The library also exports the `validate` function.

This function has the following signature:

```tsx
(value: any, rules) => validationResult;
```

Where:

- `rules` must have the same shape as the value that was passed in
- and consequently the `validationResult` will also be in that same shape

Meaning:

- If the `value` is a primitive (string, number...etc), the `rules` must be a validation fn with the signature: `(value: any) => boolean`, and the `validationResult` will be a boolean

```tsx
import { validate, isString, isInteger, isNumberMax } from 'fun-validation';

const someString = 'this is a string';

validate(someString, isString); // returns boolean

// or, you can compose your own validation fn

const someNumber = 3;

validate(someNumber, value => isInteger(value) && isNumberMax(5)(value)); // returns boolean
```

- If the `value` is an object (a plain object), the `rules` must an object with the same shape as value but the leaf nodes (primitives) have validation fns as values, and the `validationResult` will be and object in the same shape

```tsx
import { validate, isString } from 'fun-validation';
import { isDate } from 'date-fns';

const user = {
  name: 'Dusan',
  dateOfBirth: new Date(1992, 9, 2),
};

const rules = {
  name: isString,
  dateOfBirth: isDate,
};

const result = validate(user, rules);

// result
{
  name: boolean;
  dateOfBirth: boolean;
}
```

- If the `value` is an array, the `rules` must an array with two elements. First element is a validation fn and is used to validate the array itself (for example length of the array). The second element corresponds to the shape of the element in the `value` array. The `validationResult` will be an array with the first element as boolean (result of validating the array itself), and the second element as an array of booleans (result of validation for each of the elements in the `value` array).

```tsx
import { validate, isArray, isString, isInteger } from 'fun-validation';

// array of primitives

const hobbies = ['tennis', 'basketball'];

const rules = [isArray, isString];

const result = validate(hobbies, rules);

// result
[true, [true, true]];

// array of objects

const friends = [
  { name: 'Dusan', age: 29 },
  { name: 'Peter', age: 33 },
];

const rules = [isArray, { name: isString, age: isInteger }];

const result = validate(friends, rules);

// result
[
  true,
  [
    { name: true, age: true },
    { name: true, age: true },
  ],
];
```

You get the picture!

So, to recapitulate:

- The `rules` must be of the same shape as `value` with the leaf nodes (primitives) being functions that look like this: `(value: any) => boolean`
- The `validationResult` is more or less of the same shape as `value` and `rules` (except in the case of arrays) while the leaf nodes are always booleans

# API

### validate(value: any, rules) => validationResult

And a bunch of small functions whose names start with is. Will list them all some other time.

# Support

This library supports all modern browsers (so, no IE ðŸ¤®)
